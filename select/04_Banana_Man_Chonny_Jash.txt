Do you see Banana Man?
Hopping over on the white hot sand
Here he comes with some for me
(One, two, three, four)
Banana Man, we want a ton
Give us double and a bonus one
Give me more for all my friends
This banana flow will never end
Do you want a banana?
Peel it down and go mm mm, mm, mmmm
Do you want a banana? This banana's for you
You're the cattle, I'm the free
It's about whatever you want it to be
And if you dare to disagree
Surely you're the one resembling sheep
That which is funny can't be wrong
It can't be racist if I like the song
Silly, stupid, quirky, bright
All these attributes mean that I'm right
Do you want a banana?
Choke it down and go mm mm, mm, mmmm
Do you want a banana? This banana for you
He says
"look you, you're too uptight you know
You could laugh and kick it back and go
(weeee) but without a rhythm or a rhyme
You do not banana all the time
Fly away from city on the run
Try to make a little fun"
So I say "what's this, fking 1959?
With the painted face and googly eyes?
And the accent of the Caribbean?
And the imitation simian?
Weren't you born and raised in Michigan?
This banana's gotta stop"
Forget all your morals and go with the flow
Forget about the bad
The good is all you know
And forget about the voice
That's lying deep inside
The one that's screaming and screeching
Proclaiming wrong and right
And then forget about banana when
It's stuck in your throat
And when it makes you wanna bellow
But you're stuck in a choke
And then forget about the yellow
From the beckoning man
Who makes you take another one and
Make a mock of your plan
Bungale, bungalo
Conscience begone in catchy notes ummmmmmmm
Shhhhhhh
Well it's 3am and I'm online again
Arguing with someone I don't know
I shouldn't feel so strongly but
I can't let this go
The moral of this story is, it's
Tomorrow morning, on the plane
Perfectly fine to wear rose-tinted lenses
No banana make you go insane
But don't neglect your other senses
Floating back to busy town
Lest you finally face the consequences
(No banana make you want to frown)
Do you want a banana?
Peel it down and go mm mm, mm, mmmm
Do you want a banana? This banana's for
You
